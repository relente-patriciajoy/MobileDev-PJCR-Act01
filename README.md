1. What Challenges did you face installing Android Studio?
- One of the main challenges I encountered was storage space. Android Studio requires a large amount of disk space, especially during installation and when downloading SDKs and related resources. Because of this, my laptop started to lag, and I had to upgrade or free up storage before I could continue the installation properly. The heavy system requirements also affected the overall performance of my device.

2. What did you learn about Android app structure?
- I learned that the Android app structure is well-organized and easy to understand. It feels similar to how projects are arranged in Visual Studio. The files are separated into folders like java, res, and manifests, which helps you clearly see where the code, layouts, and configurations go. This organized structure makes it easier to navigate and manage the project.
